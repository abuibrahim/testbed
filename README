To use the tool create a network.xml file that wraps libvirt
definitions with a testbed tag:

<testbed uri="qemu:///system">
  <domain>
  ...
  </domain>
  ...
  <pool>
  ...
  </pool>
  ...
  <volume>
  ...
  </volume>
  ...
  <network>
  ...
  </network>
</testbed>

Here testbed uri attribute is any URI libvirt supports. If the
attribute is missing the value is read from the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI
environment variable.

The topology elements are created in the following order:

  1) pools
  2) volume that are backingStores for other volumes
  3) volumes that use backing stores
  4) networks
  5) domains

To start the topology run:

$ testbed create network.xml

To destroy:

$ testbed destroy network.xml
